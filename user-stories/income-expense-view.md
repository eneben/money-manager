# Income/Expense View

## Value Proposition

**As a user**

**I want to** view my transactions separated by income and expenses,

**so that** I can better analyse my financial activities.

## Description

Capstone Group Todo: Add wireframes

## Acceptance Criteria

- The transactions list includes a section with filter options.
- Users can filter transactions by:
  - Income
  - Expense
  - All transactions (default view)
- Only one filter option can be selected at a time.
- Selecting a new filter automatically deselects the previously selected filter.
- The applied filter is clearly displayed on the transactions list, allowing users to see which filter is currently active.
- Users can clear all filters with a single click by selecting “All transactions”, returning the list to its unfiltered state.
- The transactions list updates in real-time as filters are applied or removed.
- The account balance updates in real-time to reflect the sum of the filtered transactions:
  - Sum of all incomes when filtered by income.
  - Sum of all expenses when filtered by expense.
  - Total balance when showing all transactions.
- If no transactions match the selected filter criteria, a message is displayed indicating that no transactions were found.
