# Update Transaction

## Value Proposition

**As a user**

**I want to** update the details of existing transactions,

**so that** they reflect the most accurate and relevant information.

## Description

Capstone Group Todo: Add wireframes

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each transaction in the transactions list includes an easily accessible edit option.
- Clicking the edit option opens a form pre-filled with the transactionâ€™s existing details for modification.
- The form allows for edits to all transaction details, including:
  - Transaction Amount
  - Transaction Category
  - Transaction Type
  - Transaction Date
- All fields are mandatory.
- The form section includes options for both saving and cancelling the action.
- The cancellation option allows the user to back out of the edit process if selected by mistake or if they change their mind
- Submissions with empty mandatory fields are blocked, with validation messages indicating the missing required fields
- Upon confirming the save, the updated transaction is saved and reflected in the transactions list.
