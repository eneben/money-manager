# Delete Transaction

## Value Proposition

**As a user**

**I want to** delete incorrect transactions,

**so that** I can maintain an accurate and organised transactions list.

## Description

Capstone Group Todo: Add wireframes

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each transaction in the transactions list includes an easily accessible delete option.
- Clicking the delete option triggers a confirmation dialog.
- The dialog serves to prevent accidental deletions by asking the user to confirm their intention.
- The dialog includes options for both confirming the deletion and cancelling the action.
- The cancellation option allows the user to back out of the deletion process if selected by mistake or if they change their mind.
- Upon confirming the deletion, the transaction is removed from the transactions list, and a success message is displayed.
- If all transactions are deleted, a message appears indicating that there are no transactions and providing an option to add new ones.
